# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Privacy - encrypted databases for users without correct credentials
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by user
* Overall user convenience and ease of use, yet advanced management for admins and superadmins
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows

# Why?
* Python (original) version was becoming more bloated, convoluted and harder to compile with problematic dependencies.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility - it supports from Windows 95 up to Windows 11 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and 4.1, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11), including Windows Server NT 4.0, Widows Server 2000, Widows Server 2003, Widows Server 2008, Widows Small Business Server 2008, Widows Server 2012, Widows Server 2012 R2, Widows Server 2016, Widows Server 2019, Widows Server 2022, Widows Server 2025
* As I have been using the program's Python version, I have noticed many QoL fixes that I need to implement
