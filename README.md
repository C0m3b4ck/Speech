# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by user
* Overall user convenience and ease of use, yet advanced management for admins and superadmins
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows

# Why?
Some people do not know how to use their computer using keyboard and mouse to this day. I hope this program will help such people.
